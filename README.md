# RayTracing

This is a simple C++ ray tracing learning project.

It's based on Visual Studio 2022.

# Used Submodules

- [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for math support
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for picture reading/writing
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) not incorporated yet, maybe will be used someday
